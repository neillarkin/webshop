# Milestone Project 4 – Full Stack Development
# Online Record Store with Python and Django

## Overview
The application is a mock online record store that allows vinyl collecting enthusiasts the ability to browse and purchase contemporary and vintage vinyl records for sale. The application gives uses the ability to easily find what they are looking for by providing a search function as well as a menu that filters records per genre or per artist. Records that are not in stock can be added to a users personal wishlist and purchased at a later date.

A live version of the app is hosted here: https://neils-webshop.herokuapp.com/

## UX
The primary target audience of the application is a potential employer who may be seeking out more information on my capabilities as a developer. The employer may only spend a short time using the application and so it is vital that is no major functional bug, is fully responsive and has a clean and professional interface that gives a positive user experience. The user should be able to quickly get an idea of my competency with modern front and back-end web technologies.
 

The secondary mock target audience for the application is that of the vinyl record collector. The app provides an online service where record collectors can find and purchase vintage and modern vinyl recordings.

## Technologies
The application was built using collection of modern technologies:
* [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)  -– to define the elements of on the DOM
* [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/CSS3) – Enhance the applications user interface
* [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) – to manipulate elements on the DOM that other technologies cannot do
* [Jquery](https://jquery.com/) – Used to make JavaScript functions easier to implement
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) – Easily and quickly manipulate DOM elements and make a program responsive 
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) – Python framework that allows large complex web applications to be quickly built and easily maintained by translating SQL CRUD operations.
* [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) – Secure relational database system used for storing DB schema
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) – Used for version control and backup during development
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) – Cloud platform used for hosting production level web applications
* [AWS E3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) – Used for storage of static and media files for fast access
* [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) – Used for run test scripts after builds were pushed to Github

A complete list of technologies and versions is listed in the Requirements.txt file on Github

## Database Schema

## Testing
Test driven development methods were used during development. Django in-built unit-test features were used to perform basic test on various views and classes of the application. Defensive design was incorporated on pages where no results were found, prompting an error message for empty result sets.

### Automated tests were performed on various models, views and forms of the project.
Results of the tests can be seen here: 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/neillarkin/webshop.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/neillarkin/webshop)


1) Classes can be instantiated with local data stored in its attributes. Examples of these tests are in the test_models.py scripts throughout the various apps.

2) View functions were tested to see if they act correctly by returning a template with a status code 200 or in some cases a status 404 if incorrect parameter data was passed.

3) Forms valid data and respond appropriately when correct or incorrect data is passed.

Below is a list of the apps and automated tests that were performed:
* accounts – Login view tested for status 200. Login and Registration forms tested for validation.
* artists – Model tested for instantiation. Views tested for status 200 on all-artists and artists-records templates. Views tests for 404 codes.
* checkout – Order model tested for instantiation.
* genres – Model tested for instantiation. Views tested for status 200 on all-genres and genre-records templates. Views tests for 404 codes.
* home –  Views tested for status 200 and 404 codes
* records – Model tested for instantiation. View templates tested for status 200 on all-records and 404 for no data returned.

### Manual testing was performed on areas of the project that were not tested by automation. 

1) Launch and browse all views of the app on both Chrome and Firefox and Safari desktop browsers.
* Verify app views are accessible and not items are significantly misaligned or truncated.

2) Launch and browse all views of the app on both Chrome and Firefox and Safari mobile browsers.
* Verify app views are accessible and not items are significantly misaligned or truncated.

### Deployment
The project has been deployed to both Github and Heroku with media and static files on AWS S3. The version on Heroku is what was used for testing and is considered to be at a production level. The primary differences between both versions is in the Settings config file where the Debug mode has been disabled for security and the env variable has been commented out. 
On occasion the Github base.html may contain differences between the CSS and JS file references where they were being switched from S3 to local (Cloud9) during editing. 

#### Credits and Sources
- Most of the code concepts and logic was taken from Niels and Aarons course work in the ‘Full Stack Frameworks with Django’ modules.
- Bootstrap 4 played a significant role in making adjustments to UI compared to previous projects where adjustments were done in CSS3
- Some forms such as Registration, Login, Checkout, Password Reset forms are taken from the Boostrap 4 library
